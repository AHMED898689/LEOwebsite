# LEOwebsite
Earth observation (EO) is gathering information about planet Earth's
systems which can help policymakers make more informed decisions to
address natural disasters and other environmental issues.
However, they need to have the knowledge and skills to apply EO in their
work.
LEO is a remarkably simple yet very convenient website that will help
anyone find the most suitable EO training for them.
By signing up, you will determine your level to get to a fitting interface
designed for you.
The beginner’s interface will be simpler containing only beginner-level
trainings to avoid distraction. We also provide costumed programs of
different courses to get you on a steady path.
On the other side, the experts’ interface has a lot of well-organized
resources that you can surf or search for specific training from the search
bar or choose the category of training you need (topic/level/…)
You will be asked to sign up for an account to save your progress and
continue your training from any device. this will allow you to add
feedback and rate courses.
Additionally, after finishing any training you will get suggestions for
other related ones based on your view history.
You will also have a badge of the training added to your account and
users with two or more badges in common will have optional combats.
The winners will have their names viewed on the website in the heroes’
section and receive a certificate from the website as a reward.
We will also help deaf and mute people to understand our training videos
easily by translating videos to sign language. This will be available by
encouraging volunteers who already know sign language to be part of our
website, at the same time, they will be learning a lot about earth
observation.
